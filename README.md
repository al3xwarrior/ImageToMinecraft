# ImageToMinecraft
Go through each pixel in a image to turn it into the closest color code. Upload your image and click the convert button to show a list of each line. You can them copy these lines and put them into whatever you want. It is originally designed for Hypixel Housing but can be used for anything

# Small Note
This is my first project ever using HTML. It was fun to make. Updates will be small additions. Huge shoutout to ChatGippity for helping me with finding the indivisual pixel in a image as well as coverting that pixel to the nearest set color (which determined the minecraft color code)
